          <p>The <strong>RequestBody</strong> currently includes the <strong>filters</strong> property, which serves as a placeholder for future enhancements. As of now, the <strong>all</strong> property is supported, functioning as an AND condition where all specified filters must match.</p>

      requestBody:
        description: |+
          <p>The <strong>RequestBody</strong> currently includes the <strong>filters</strong> property, which serves as a placeholder for future enhancements. As of now, the <strong>all</strong> property is supported, functioning as an AND condition where all specified filters must match.</p>

          <p><strong>Current functionality:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>all</strong>: When this property is used, all of the filters included must match for the request to be processed. This is equivalent to an AND condition in logical operations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a request body specifies filters for <strong>owners</strong> as <strong>["admin", "john"]</strong> and <strong>tags</strong> as <strong>["tag1", "tag2"]</strong>, then only items that are both of the 'admin' or 'john' owner and tagged with 'tag1' or 'tag2' will match.</p>

          <p>The <strong>RequestBody</strong> currently includes the <strong>filters</strong> property, which serves as a placeholder for future enhancements. As of now, the <strong>all</strong> property is supported, functioning as an AND condition where all specified filters must match.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>all</strong>: When this property is used, all of the filters included must match for the request to be processed. This is equivalent to an AND condition in logical operations.</li>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a request body specifies filters for <strong>states</strong> as <strong>["required", "implemented"]</strong> and <strong>tags</strong> as <strong>["tag1", "tag2"]</strong>, then only items that are both in the 'required' or 'implemented' states and tagged with 'tag1' or 'tag2' will match.</p>

      requestBody:
        description: |+
          <p>The <strong>RequestBody</strong> currently includes the <strong>filters</strong> property, which serves as a placeholder for future enhancements. As of now, the <strong>all</strong> property is supported, functioning as an AND condition where all specified filters must match.</p>

          <p><strong>Current functionality:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>all</strong>: When this property is used, all of the filters included must match for the request to be processed. This is equivalent to an AND condition in logical operations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a request body specifies filters for <strong>states</strong> as <strong>["required", "implemented"]</strong> and <strong>tags</strong> as <strong>["tag1", "tag2"]</strong>, then only items that are both in the 'required' or 'implemented' states and tagged with 'tag1' or 'tag2' will match.</p>

          Filter to apply to the returned items. It is possible to filter by any property of the response.

          The full filter string must be passed in a single **filter** query parameter. Providing multiple **filter** parameters will lead to unexpected results.
          Both the properties and values must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
          | Operator | Description | Example |
          | -------- | ----------- |-------- |

          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |
          | <        | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup>** than the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'<'value'** |
          | >=       | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value      | /resources?filter=**'field'>='value'** |
          | <=       | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<='value'** |
          | ~        | Returns items where the string property **contains, ignorecase**, the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'~'value'** |
          | IN       | Returns items where the list property **contains** any of the values | /resources?filter=**'field'IN'value1,value2,...'** |
          | :AND:    | Returns items that comply with **both** filters                | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':AND:'field2'<>'value2'** |
          | :OR:     | Returns items that comply with **at least one** of the filters | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':OR:'field2'<>'value2'** |

          <sup>1</sup> Bigger and smaller according to normal sorting. Applicable to: dates, timestamps, numbers, strings.
          The following data types support filtering:
          - Boolean
          - String
          - Enumerations
          - Numeric
          - Dates
          - Timestamps

          **AND** and **OR** operators can be combined. They can be grouped using parenthesis. Example:
          ```
          /resources?filter=('field1'='value1':OR:'field2'='value2'):AND:('field3'<>'value3':OR:'field4'='value4')

          Filter to apply to the returned items. It is possible to filter by any property of the response.

          The full filter string must be passed in a single **filter** query parameter. Providing multiple **filter** parameters will lead to unexpected results.
          Both the properties and values must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
          | Operator | Description | Example |
          | -------- | ----------- |-------- |
          | =        | Returns items where the property **equals** to the value           | /resources?filter=**'field'='value'** |

          | <>       | Returns items where the property is **not equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>'value'** |
          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |
          | <        | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup>** than the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'<'value'** |
          | >=       | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value      | /resources?filter=**'field'>='value'** |
          | <=       | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<='value'** |
          | ~        | Returns items where the string property **contains, ignorecase**, the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'~'value'** |
          | IN       | Returns items where the list property **contains** any of the values | /resources?filter=**'field'IN'value1,value2,...'** |
          | :AND:    | Returns items that comply with **both** filters                | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':AND:'field2'<>'value2'** |
          | :OR:     | Returns items that comply with **at least one** of the filters | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':OR:'field2'<>'value2'** |

          - Enumerations
          - Numeric
          - Dates
          - Timestamps

          **AND** and **OR** operators can be combined. They can be grouped using parenthesis. Example:
          ```
          /resources?filter=('field1'='value1':OR:'field2'='value2'):AND:('field3'<>'value3':OR:'field4'='value4')

          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |

        Retrieves a list of projects for the current user.
        If the user has one of these permissions:
        PRODUCTS_LIST_ALL, PRODUCTS_LIST_ALL_READ_ONLY they can see all the projects. Otherwise, they will only be able to see those projects for which they have visibility.
        The filters available to get the project's list are:
        - referenceId
        - name
      operationId: getAllProjectsSummary
      parameters:
      - name: filter
        in: query
        description: |-
          Filter to apply to the returned items. It is possible to filter by any property of the response.

          The full filter string must be passed in a single **filter** query parameter. Providing multiple **filter** parameters will lead to unexpected results.
          Both the properties and values must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
          | Operator | Description | Example |
          | -------- | ----------- |-------- |
          | =        | Returns items where the property **equals** to the value           | /resources?filter=**'field'='value'** |
          | =NULL    | Returns items where the property **is null**, it has no value     | /resources?filter=**'field'=NULL** |
          | <>       | Returns items where the property is **not equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>'value'** |
          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |
          | <        | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup>** than the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'<'value'** |
          | >=       | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value      | /resources?filter=**'field'>='value'** |
          | <=       | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<='value'** |
          | ~        | Returns items where the string property **contains, ignorecase**, the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'~'value'** |
          | IN       | Returns items where the list property **contains** any of the values | /resources?filter=**'field'IN'value1,value2,...'** |
          | :AND:    | Returns items that comply with **both** filters                | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':AND:'field2'<>'value2'** |
          | :OR:     | Returns items that comply with **at least one** of the filters | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':OR:'field2'<>'value2'** |

          - Enumerations
          - Numeric
          - Dates
          - Timestamps

          **AND** and **OR** operators can be combined. They can be grouped using parenthesis. Example:
          ```
          /resources?filter=('field1'='value1':OR:'field2'='value2'):AND:('field3'<>'value3':OR:'field4'='value4')
