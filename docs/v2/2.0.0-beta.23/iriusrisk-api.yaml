          Filter to apply to the returned items. It is possible to filter by any property of the response.

          The full filter string must be passed in a single **filter** query parameter. Providing multiple **filter** parameters will lead to unexpected results.
          Both the properties and values must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
          | Operator | Description | Example |
          | -------- | ----------- |-------- |
          | =        | Returns items where the property **equals** to the value           | /resources?filter=**'field'='value'** |

          | <>       | Returns items where the property is **not equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>'value'** |
          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |
          | <        | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup>** than the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'<'value'** |
          | >=       | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value      | /resources?filter=**'field'>='value'** |
          | <=       | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<='value'** |
          | ~        | Returns items where the string property **contains, ignorecase**, the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'~'value'** |
          | IN       | Returns items where the list property **contains** any of the values | /resources?filter=**'field'IN'value1,value2,...'** |
          | :AND:    | Returns items that comply with **both** filters                | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':AND:'field2'<>'value2'** |
          | :OR:     | Returns items that comply with **at least one** of the filters | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':OR:'field2'<>'value2'** |

          - Numeric
          - Dates
          - Timestamps

          **AND** and **OR** operators can be combined. They can be grouped using parenthesis. Example:
          ```
          /resources?filter=('field1'='value1':OR:'field2'='value2'):AND:('field3'<>'value3':OR:'field4'='value4')

          <p>The <strong>RequestBody</strong> currently includes the <strong>filters</strong> property, which serves as a placeholder for future enhancements. As of now, the <strong>all</strong> property is supported, functioning as an AND condition where all specified filters must match.</p>

          <p><strong>Current functionality:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>all</strong>: When this property is used, all of the filters included must match for the request to be processed. This is equivalent to an AND condition in logical operations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a request body specifies filters for <strong>states</strong> as <strong>["required", "implemented"]</strong> and <strong>tags</strong> as <strong>["tag1", "tag2"]</strong>, then only items that are both in the 'required' or 'implemented' states and tagged with 'tag1' or 'tag2' will match.</p>

          | <>       | Returns items where the property is **not equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>'value'** |
          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |
          | <        | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup>** than the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'<'value'** |
          | >=       | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value      | /resources?filter=**'field'>='value'** |
          | <=       | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<='value'** |

          Filter to apply to the returned items. It is possible to filter by any property of the response.

          The full filter string must be passed in a single **filter** query parameter. Providing multiple **filter** parameters will lead to unexpected results.
          Both the properties and values must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
          | Operator | Description | Example |
          | -------- | ----------- |-------- |
          | =        | Returns items where the property **equals** to the value           | /resources?filter=**'field'='value'** |

          | <>       | Returns items where the property is **not equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>'value'** |
          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |
          | <        | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup>** than the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'<'value'** |
          | >=       | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value      | /resources?filter=**'field'>='value'** |
          | <=       | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<='value'** |
          | ~        | Returns items where the string property **contains, ignorecase**, the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'~'value'** |
          | IN       | Returns items where the list property **contains** any of the values | /resources?filter=**'field'IN'value1,value2,...'** |
          | :AND:    | Returns items that comply with **both** filters                | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':AND:'field2'<>'value2'** |
          | :OR:     | Returns items that comply with **at least one** of the filters | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':OR:'field2'<>'value2'** |

          <sup>1</sup> Bigger and smaller according to normal sorting. Applicable to: dates, timestamps, numbers, strings.
          The following data types support filtering:
          - Boolean
          - String
          - Enumerations
          - Numeric
          - Dates
          - Timestamps

          **AND** and **OR** operators can be combined. They can be grouped using parenthesis. Example:
          ```
          /resources?filter=('field1'='value1':OR:'field2'='value2'):AND:('field3'<>'value3':OR:'field4'='value4')

          Filter to apply to the returned items. It is possible to filter by any property of the response.

          The full filter string must be passed in a single **filter** query parameter. Providing multiple **filter** parameters will lead to unexpected results.
          Both the properties and values must be enclosed in single quotation marks.
          | Operator | Description | Example |
          | -------- | ----------- |-------- |
          | =        | Returns items where the property **equals** to the value           | /resources?filter=**'field'='value'** |

          | <>       | Returns items where the property is **not equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>'value'** |
          | <>NULL   | Returns items where the property **is not null**, it has any value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<>NULL** |
          | >        | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup>** than the value   | /resources?filter=**'field'>'value'** |
          | <        | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup>** than the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'<'value'** |
          | >=       | Returns items where the property is **bigger<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value      | /resources?filter=**'field'>='value'** |
          | <=       | Returns items where the property is **smaller<sup>1</sup> or equal** to the value     | /resources?filter=**'field'<='value'** |
          | ~        | Returns items where the string property **contains, ignorecase**, the value  | /resources?filter=**'field'~'value'** |
          | IN       | Returns items where the list property **contains** any of the values | /resources?filter=**'field'IN'value1,value2,...'** |
          | :AND:    | Returns items that comply with **both** filters                | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':AND:'field2'<>'value2'** |
          | :OR:     | Returns items that comply with **at least one** of the filters | /resources?filter=**'field1'='value1':OR:'field2'<>'value2'** |
